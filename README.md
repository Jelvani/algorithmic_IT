# Algorithmic Information Theory
> Resources for learning about information theory, Kolomgrov complexity, recursion theory, and theoretical computer science.

## Motivation
I gained interest in this field when I first started experimenting and looking into algorithmic art, and learned about the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). Through some online resources, this led me to read more about [fractals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal), which is something you are introduced to in an intro to computer science course - regarding recursive functions. Finding the connection to fractals and the Mandelbrot set resparked my interest into how something so complex can come out of such simplicity, in a way analogous to life. 

Ofcourse I began doing more research, I found [this](https://www.stsci.edu/~lbradley/seminar/index.html) website, which related chaos and fractals, and from here I looked into [iterated function systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system), and was even more mind-blown when I saw the Barnsley's fern, which is convientely constructed from a few matrices and probabilities. From here, I went on to looking into [Lindenmayer systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system), and how "life" can be formalized into a simple string (related to [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)).

This leads me to creating this repository, and explaining the beuty behind this. I came across the [Hutter Prize](http://prize.hutter1.net/) recently, and it resparked my interest in the topic. More specifiecley, Hutter claims that the ability to compress something very well is related to intelligence. This coincides with all of the previous readings I did on fractals, and how such a simple rule can leads to chaos. But with life, this chaos can have some meaning. 

All of the interesting topics from before, I found can be catagorized into the field of [Algorithmic information theory](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Algorithmic_information_theory), which relates very closely to Lindenmayer systems.

This repository will include a bunch of resources and tests I would like to perform to work on compressing strings, or creating something out of almost nothing!

## TODO
* How do Godels Incompletness theorems fit into the picture of this topic?
